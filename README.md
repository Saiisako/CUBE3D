# ðŸ§Š CUBE3D

Project developed as part of our training program, in collaboration with **Naankour**.

##  Description

**CUBE3D** is a simple 3D rendering engine using **raycasting**, inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*.  
It generates a pseudo-3D first-person view from a 2D map. See this as 2.5D :)
Developed in **C** using the **MiniLibX** library.

## Features

- Real-time rendering with raycasting
- `.cub` file parsing (map + texture paths)
- Player movement and rotation
- Wall texture mapping
- Optional minimap

## Technologies

- C  
- MiniLibX  
- Makefile

## Build & Run

make minilibx
make
./cube3D map/[select_map]
